# Influentialthreads
Insight Data Science Project

Influentialthreads is an application developed during the Insight Data Science Program hosted on www.influentialthreads.site 

Social media influencers, individuals who have stablished credibility in a specific industry, are becoming a fundamental piece in marketing campaigns for various industries, including fashion, beauty and lifestyle. According to statistics reported in the Fashion Monitor and Econsultancy report, fashion marketers reported allocating between 30% and 75% of their total marketing budget to influencer marketing, looking for influencers with small but consistent audiences to those with hundreds of thousands of followers, depending mostly on the brand and the targeted audience. 

It is however a very competitive job, and while some will flourish effortlessly, others can struggle to gain traction. There are many variants an influencer starter should focus on, many of such depending on the brands and audience the influencer wishes to attract, and one of those is how to compose each post, such that it maximizes its influence. What should an influencer focus on when beginning his or her blog or social media posts? 

I wanted to understand and find out what insights we could gain on a composition of a post and the level of influence, from looking at the data. In this project I explore and analyse data collected from Tumblr, a blog repository, to find insights that help improve a post influence in the social media platform.

Influentialthreads helps fashion bloggers increase the influence of their posts, helping the user test the post and decide what they need to focus when writing a blog. 
The repo contains the complete data and machine learning pipeline from the collection, text scrapping, processing and cleansing of the data from the Tumblr API to the implementation of the app in a AWS server, using various tools such as: beautifulsoup, nltk, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn in Python and flask, bootstrap, AWS for web interface.
A Random Forests classifier was applied in the algorithm to predict the outcome on a post influence.
