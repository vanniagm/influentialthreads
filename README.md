# Influentialthreads
Insight Data Science Project

Influentialthreads is an application developed during the Insight Data Science Program hosted on www.influentialthreads.site 

Influentialthreads helps fashion bloggers increase the influence of their posts, helping the user test the post and decide what they need to focus when writing a blog. 
The repo contains the complete data and machine learning pipeline from the collection, text scrapping, processing and cleansing of the data from the Tumblr API to the implementation of the app in a AWS server, using various tools such as: beautifulsoup, nltk, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn in Python and flask, bootstrap, AWS for web interface.
A Random Forests classifier was applied in the algorithm to predict the outcome on a post influence.

I implemented or edited code chunks in various of the modules based on discussions or codes form other Insight Fellows such as Jamie Antonelli (plot_features) or Ruth Toner (cleaning module).
